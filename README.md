# Welcome to Tailwind Traders Data and Assets
This repo has data, imagery, fonts and style guides for the Tailwind Traders "story". If you have any questions, please ping [Rob Conery](mailto:robcon@microsoft.com) or [Scott Cate](scott.cate@microsoft.com).

## Design Assets
In the `assets` folder you'll see the fonts that were used in the design brief for Tailwind. You'll also see various logos and super high to normal resolution. In addition, there are images from Pixabay in the products directory. If you want to add more products, please:

 1. Fork this repo and create a pull request with your images. We can only use images we own or those released under Created Commons 0 (public domain), which Pixabay has. You should be able to find what you need.
 1. Add a title, price, sku and description in the PR so we can update Airtable.

## Data
There are 2 ways (currently) to interact with the data: documents and SQL scripts. The entire database can be loaded into PostgreSQL in a single script file or, if you're using a document/key value store, you can use the JSON documents in the `docs` directory.

### PostgreSQL Instructions
You can find a PostgreSQL database in the `postgres` directory, which has a README that will tell you how to set it up. There's also a SQL Server directory (`sql_server`) with a README. Basically: you can load it to PostgreSQL yourself, run in in Docker, or push it to Azure using a shell script - up to you.

SQL Server is forthcoming.

# Tailwind Traders Acquires Northwind

**REDMOND, WA December 06, 2018** Tailwind Traders, Inc announced that it has agreed to acquire Northwind Traders, the venerable "old guard" international foods company, in an effort to bolster its virtual hardware offerings with some international culinary flare. Tailwind agreed to acquire Northwind for an undisclosed sum and will assume control of all of Northwind's virtual assets, including the company's flagship product: _Aniseed Syrup_/

"This is a profoundly wonderful development for all involved, and will help to bring our food products to a whole new sector of the market" stated Nancy Daviolo, Executive Vice President of Operations. "We couldn't be happier with the arrangement". The recently-promoted Daviolo will join the Tailwind executive team along with two of her close associates, Margaret Peacock and Michael Suyama. Daviolo took over Northwind's sales operations in 2012 after Andrew Fuller was forced out of the company as a result of charges of fraud and embezzlement of more than 5,000 cases of Grandma's Boysenberry Spread.

Tailwind Traders is quickly making a name for itself in the relatively new virtual hardware market. Founded in 2017 by digital entrepreneurs Dee Yan and M. Sullivan, they made a splash by blending the ease of online shopping with the familiarity of a mom-n-pop corner hardware store. "Hardware stores are becoming all the same: huge, open factory spaces where you walk in, smell fertilizers and are visually and aurally assaulted by blinking lights and sirens from giant machines driving around the floor. We want to change all that" said Ms. Yan. "We want you to feel like you're visiting your neighbor's garage. Not just any neighbor though - this neighbor has _every_ tool and his a complete tech nerd. Your shopping experience can be wandering up and down the aisles, viewing our amazing product line or you can browse the screen on our Johnny Cart" Ms. Yan says, pointing to the company's trademark AI-powered shopping cart.

"There's no need to sit at home and browse online for a hammer. Just come to one of our stores and our Johnny Cart will take you right to it. If you like it, you can buy it directly from the cart and we'll drone-deliver it right to your house or apartment before you even get home!"

Indeed, innovations such as the Johnny Cart are changing the way we shop for things altogether. Another Tailwind innovation, the _OxBox_, is a virtual reality headset that allows you to shop their store with a visual guide and marketing overlays. Initially received with a large amount of skepticism, the OxBox has become a favorite of Tailwind Shoppers. "I know I can use an app on my phone, but it's much more fun to come down to the store and pick things up - see how heavy they are, if they're the right size and so on. The OxBox is such a great help for that. Just the other day I came in looking for a replacement bolt for one of the blades I managed to shear off of my QuadJumper (everyone's fine, by the way). I held the sheared end of the bolt up in front of the OxBox and it knew the exact size and where it was located. It also told me that it would be easier to just buy a blade replacement pack as the repairs would otherwise need to be done by a professional repairperson. So that's what I did!"

Tailwind has a devoted customer base, who will now have the opportunity of adding a 6-pack of Laughing Lumberjack Lager Lager or Queso Cabrales to their checkout. "We find that a lot of shoppers come in during the daytime, right around noon when they're hungry. We use the OxBox to tell us what the customer is interested in and with some algorithms running in the background, whether they might like a snack such as Uncle Bob's Organic Dried Pears or something. The algorithm does this automatically - suggesting it right through the OxBox" Anne Dodsworth, Tailwind's new head of marketing explains. "We use technology to its fullest to help our customers find what they want, and what they don't even know they want!"

Ms. Dodsworth is referring to Tailwind's use of Machine Learning, which helps the sales team decide the probabilities of all kinds of things: from desired sales items to what someone might want to snack on at checkout.

"We couldn't do all of this if we weren't fully virtualized in the cloud" states M. Sullivan, Tailwind's CTO, who spoke with us over email. "We don't own any computer hardware, aside from the hardware you see in the retail store that enhances our shopper's experience. All of our processes: from the machine learning algorithms to the recommendation engines and even the checkout process - it's all done in the cloud."

Tailwind hosts its entire infrastructure on Microsoft Azure, and is serving as the blueprint for "modern retail".


## About Tailwind

Tailwind Traders was founded with a technology spirit and a sound approach: to offer our customers and stakeholders unmatched performance.
From our humble beginnings that set out to connect buyers of our core product lines with world-class vendors and manufacturers now has become a pervasive international enterprise focused on delivering value, efficiency, speed and quality. Tailwind Traders is true to our mission of hyper-focused customer satisfaction uniting the World with fast and accurate delivery on every step of our mission through technology. While customers are always the focus, many of our acclaimed stories could not be possible without an emphasis on empowering the Tailwind Traders team, vendors and integrated supply chain.

In our past, unconnected systems were a huge challenge. Converting paper-based and unaligned data meant hours and hours of human intervention and added unmanageable risk. These variables added unplanned outages, unpredictable expenses and eroded profits just to mention a few. Even morale suffered. We found that when our team felt sure, individual performance and satisfaction soared.
The next chapter on our journey has now been completed with the deep history and approach from our recent acquisition and integration of Northwind Traders. By leveraging the well-tuned database approach of Northwind and applying today’s modern technologies we have been able to lurch a traditional business model forward for today’s hyper-competitive landscape.

We set out to be the World leader in our craft – solidly connecting our customers, staff, management, vendors and supply chain.
At its core, there is nothing complicated about it. Expert technology makes for great business.

We believe that our customers and organization deserve and should expect more – more efficiency, more value, more service. Therefore, that is why we say…

“We are your Tailwind.”

## Mission

Technology is our tool chest. When we deliver fast and accurate unbridled value through our services and products to our customers, team and stakeholders, cross borders and languages through employing the power of technology we have succeeded in our mission.
